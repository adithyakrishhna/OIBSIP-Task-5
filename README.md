# Sales Prediction Using Python

This repository contains a machine learning model for sales prediction using Python. The model uses linear regression to predict sales based on advertising data.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of building a sales prediction model using Python and machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project is the "Advertising.csv" file, which contains information about advertising spending on TV, radio, and newspapers, as well as sales figures.

## Procedure

Follow these steps to build and evaluate the sales prediction model:

1. **Import Libraries**: Begin by importing the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

2. **Import Dataset**: Load the dataset from the "Advertising.csv" file into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**: Explore the dataset through data visualization techniques. Generate a pairplot and a heatmap to visualize relationships and correlations between variables.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the data, including scaling the features and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Linear Regression Model**: Create a linear regression model using scikit-learn. Train the model using the training dataset.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using common regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Square Root of Mean Absolute Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning, specifically linear regression, for sales prediction based on advertising data. The model can be utilized for making sales forecasts and optimizing advertising strategies.
